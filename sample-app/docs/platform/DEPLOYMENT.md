# Deployment

This project creates a directory-style homebrew application and optional
filesystem images. Tagged releases also provide the complete directory as a
ZIP archive. Its Makefile can update the directory or upload an image below
`/data/homebrew` over FTP. It does not configure the console, start payloads,
register titles, launch applications, or create a signed retail package.

## Requirements

Use a console you own with an already configured, compatible homebrew
environment and loader. Follow that loader's documentation for setup and
supported input formats. This repository does not configure the console.

Keep loader, mount, and FTP services on a trusted local network. The automated
path uses Python 3's standard-library FTP client and requires an already-running
FTP service on the console.

## One-command development deployment

Build and update the title folder through the default FTP port `2121`:

```bash
make deploy PS5_HOST=192.168.1.100
```

The default folder deployment:

1. builds `dist/<TITLE_ID>/` from the current source;
2. uploads each file beside its destination under a hidden `.upload` name;
3. replaces that file only after its transfer completes;
4. publishes `eboot.bin` and then `sce_sys/param.json` last; and
5. verifies that both required files appear in the remote directory.

The FTP client uses current-directory `MLSD` checks and accepts any successful
2xx completion for file deletion. This accommodates the homebrew `ftpsrv`
behavior used by the validated 6.02 and 12.70 environments while preserving
the temporary-upload and required-file gates.

Keeping `/data/homebrew/<TITLE_ID>/` itself in place preserves ShadowMountPlus's
existing nullfs source while updating what the next launch reads. Fully close
the application before deploying and do not launch it until the command
finishes. Files removed from the local build are not deleted remotely; clean
the title directory with `make undeploy` when an exact reset is required.

Select an image or a non-default port with Make variables:

```bash
make deploy PS5_HOST=192.168.1.100 DEPLOY_FORMAT=ffpfsc
make deploy PS5_HOST=192.168.1.100 FTP_PORT=2121 DEPLOY_FORMAT=ffpkg
```

Image deployment remains useful for distribution testing. An already-mounted
image with the same pathname may remain cached by ShadowMountPlus, so folder
deployment is the recommended repeated development workflow. Do not keep a
folder and an image with the same title ID in scan paths at the same time.

Supported variables are:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PS5_HOST` | required | Console IPv4 address or hostname |
| `FTP_PORT` | `2121` | FTP service port |
| `DEPLOY_FORMAT` | `folder` | `folder`, `ffpfsc`, or `ffpkg` output |
| `PS5_FTP_USER` | `anonymous` | FTP username |
| `PS5_FTP_PASSWORD` | `codex` | FTP password |
| `DEPLOY_DRY_RUN` | `0` | Use `1` to build and print the target without networking |

For repeated local work, copy `.env.example` to the ignored `.env` file and
set `PS5_HOST`, `FTP_PORT`, and `DEPLOY_FORMAT` there. Command-line Make values
still override file defaults.

For example, validate local packaging and the resolved destination without
contacting a console:

```bash
make deploy PS5_HOST=192.0.2.1 DEPLOY_DRY_RUN=1
```

## Remove the staged development copy

Fully close the application, then remove the current `titleId` from the FTP
staging area:

```bash
make undeploy PS5_HOST=192.168.1.100
```

The command validates `sce_sys/param.json`, recursively removes only
`/data/homebrew/<TITLE_ID>/`, and deletes exact same-ID `.ffpkg` and `.ffpfsc`
files plus interrupted-upload temporary images. It never deletes the
`/data/homebrew` root or another title. Preview the resolved targets without a
network request by adding `DEPLOY_DRY_RUN=1`.

This is deliberately named **undeploy**, not uninstall: FTP removal does not
unregister the title from the PS5 Shell database. A stale home-screen entry may
remain until the loader refreshes or dedicated, separately authorized cleanup
tooling unregisters it. The command fails if the FTP server cannot enumerate a
directory safely or if an active mount prevents removal.

## Recommended edit-test loop

1. Fully close the previous application and any remaining crash dialog.
2. Confirm the console's FTP and mount services are ready.
3. Edit the source. Update `contentVersion` in `sce_sys/param.json` for a
   release-worthy change; routine folder deployments do not require a bump.
4. Run `make deploy PS5_HOST=<console-address>`.
5. Wait for the mount service to report the title ready, then launch it
   manually.
6. Observe the result and fully close the application before deploying again.

Keeping launch and close actions manual makes the default command predictable
and avoids replacing a package while its previous title remains active.

## Manual build and stage

1. Build the exact format accepted by your loader:

   ```bash
   make          # directory form
   make ffpkg    # directory plus UFS2 image
   make ffpfsc   # directory plus compressed image
   ```

2. Choose one complete output supported by the loader:

   - `dist/<TITLE_ID>/`: directory form;
   - `dist/<TITLE_ID>.ffpkg`: UFS2 image;
   - `dist/<TITLE_ID>.ffpfsc`: compressed image.

3. For directory deployment, stage the entire `dist/<TITLE_ID>/` tree. Do not
   upload only `eboot.bin`.
4. Wait for the loader to report that the title is ready, then launch it from
   the Games section of the home screen.

Use `make packages` only when both optional image formats are needed. Rebuild
the selected format immediately before deployment so an older package is not
mistaken for the current application.

## Deploy a tagged-release ZIP

Tagged GitHub Releases include `<TITLE_ID>.zip` as a transport-friendly copy
of the validated directory-style application. Extract it locally; the archive
contains one top-level `<TITLE_ID>/` folder. Upload that complete folder so the
result is `/data/homebrew/<TITLE_ID>/eboot.bin` with its `sce_sys/`,
`sce_module/`, and asset directories beside it.

Do not upload the ZIP file itself and do not extract only its contents directly
into `/data/homebrew`. ShadowMountPlus consumes the extracted title folder, not
the ZIP container. Releases carry no `.ffpfsc` image; one built locally with
`make ffpfsc` holds the same application content, so stage only one form for a
given title ID.

## Smoke test

The default skeleton hides the splash screen, renders the Hello World frame,
loads `/app0/assets/banner.txt`, and remains alive. Close it through the
home-screen interface.

The skeleton intentionally keeps `main` alive. Do not return from `main` or
call an exit function unless the target loader and application lifecycle
explicitly support that path.

If launch fails, see [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
