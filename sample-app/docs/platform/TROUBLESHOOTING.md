# Troubleshooting

## Linux, WSL, or the native toolchain is missing

On Linux or WSL, run:

```bash
make doctor
```

On Windows PowerShell, run:

```powershell
./tools/doctor.ps1
```

On Linux or inside WSL, confirm the native toolchain:

```bash
test -x /usr/bin/clang-18
test -x /usr/bin/clang++
test -x /usr/bin/curl
test -x /usr/bin/wget
test -x /usr/bin/unzip
test -x /usr/bin/tar
test -x /usr/bin/llvm-ar-18
```

On Ubuntu, install missing host packages with:

```bash
sudo apt install clang-18 clang-format-18 clang-tidy-18 curl lld-18 make python3 python3-pip python3-venv tar unzip wget
```

## The generated `libc.prx` is missing or has the wrong hash

Run the source reproducer, which verifies both release digests:

```bash
make libc
```

Normal `make` builds it automatically when absent. Do not replace it with a
module extracted from a game or firmware.

## The linker reports unresolved symbols

Check spelling, C versus C++ linkage, and whether the needed static archive is
listed in `APP_STATIC_ARCHIVES` or the relevant `PACBREW_*` variable. Platform
imports must exist in the public SDK stubs under
`.deps/native/ps5-payload-sdk/target/lib`. Do not silence unresolved symbols;
update the SDK or provide a legitimate native implementation.

## The title stops launching after adding imports or static data

Symptom: a smaller fSELF launches, but a larger build is rejected before
`main()` even though every imported NID exists on the target firmware. On an
observed firmware 12.02 folder deployment this presented as launch result
`0x80aa001a`.

Check every mapped `PT_LOAD` in the generated `eboot.elf`: its file offset and
virtual address must have the same residue modulo `0x4000`. In particular,
RELRO starts at its first section, which is `.data.rel.ro` whenever the
program has relocated read-only data, not at `.got`. An older writer used the
GOT file offset and could silently generate an incongruent segment when the
binary layout changed.

Current tooling anchors the RELRO file offset to the section that begins the
region (`.data.rel.ro` when lld keeps it, otherwise the GOT, since lld drops the
empty section in programs such as the Hello World template) and rejects an
incongruent load during the host build. Rebuild `ps5-native-tool` after updating
`tooling/native/sce_module_writer.cpp`; reusing an older binary preserves the
bug even when the source is fixed. This issue concerns ELF layout, not network
permissions or the correctness of a particular import.

## Native dependency bootstrap fails

The first build needs network access to download the hash-pinned public PS5
payload SDK and upstream zlib source archive. Retry:

```bash
make deps
```

The script writes only to `.deps/native/` and never installs packages globally.

## Optional package setup fails

- `.ffpkg` requires Git, the .NET SDK 8 or newer, and network access on first
  use. UFS2Tool and its build output are stored under `.deps/UFS2Tool`.
- `.ffpfsc` requires Git and Python 3.9 or newer with `venv` support. MkPFS and
  its isolated environment are stored under `.deps/MkPFS`.
- Folder output has neither optional dependency. Use `make app` to isolate
  packaging from compilation.

Nothing is installed globally by these optional bootstrappers.

## FTP deployment fails

- Confirm `PS5_HOST` identifies the intended console and its FTP service is
  already running on `FTP_PORT` (default `2121`).
- Run `make deploy PS5_HOST=192.0.2.1 DEPLOY_DRY_RUN=1` to validate the local
  build and destination without sending a network request.
- Fully close the previous title and any crash dialog before replacing its
  files. Never launch while deployment is still running.
- A remaining hidden `.upload` file indicates that a transfer or rename did
  not finish. Rerunning deployment safely overwrites that temporary file.
- Folder deployment intentionally does not delete remote files absent from the
  new build. Manually clean the title directory if a removed asset or module
  must disappear.
- Do not leave both a title folder and an image with the same title ID under
  active scan paths. ShadowMountPlus may prefer its existing mounted source.
- Wait for the mount service to report the title ready before launching. The
  Make target uploads only; it does not launch the app.

## The title does not appear

- Confirm `dist/<TITLE_ID>/sce_sys/param.json` and `icon0.png` exist.
- Confirm another title is not still active in the loader.
- Use a title ID not already registered by another application.
- Wait for the directory loader's explicit ready/installed message.
- Stage the whole title directory, not only `eboot.bin`.

## The icon, background, or selection audio does not update

- Run `make`; both the Make and PowerShell builds validate the tracked
  presentation assets before compiling.
- Confirm `icon0.png`, `pic0.dds`, and `pic1.dds` reached
  `dist/<TITLE_ID>/sce_sys/`.
- Selection and launch pictures must be 3840x2160 DX10 DDS files using BC7 UNORM. A PNG
  renamed to `.dds` is not sufficient.
- Audio must be ATRAC9 in a RIFF container named exactly `snd0.at9`; renaming
  MP3 or AAC input does not convert it.
- The RIFF must contain one `smpl` loop. If selecting the app stops default
  home-screen music but remains silent, inspect the chunk list.
- `Base.BgmController: Invalid file size` means Shell rejected the file. The
  observed limit is 2,097,152 bytes (2 MiB), not a fixed duration. At stereo
  192 kb/s, keep input at or below 4,193,024 samples (87.354666667 seconds) so
  frame padding stays below the ceiling.
- Presentation metadata may be cached for an already registered title. Follow
  the loader's documented refresh procedure after structural changes.
- Retail-style custom logos and descriptions are Internet catalog metadata,
  not package assets for a synthetic homebrew concept.

## The app immediately crashes

- Do not return from `main` or call an exit function.
- Keep the generated runtime digest unchanged while testing the baseline.
- Keep the default FSELF magic and SDK pair until the baseline launches.
- Run `tools/inspect.ps1 dist/<TITLE_ID>/eboot.bin` and resolve every error.
- Consult loader diagnostics; the home-screen message alone is not a root
  cause.

## `/download0` is missing

Keep a positive `downloadDataSize` in `sce_sys/param.json`, rebuild, and stage the
new generated directory. Do not attempt to write to `/app0`.
